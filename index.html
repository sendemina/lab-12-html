    <h4>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
      remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
      of Letraset sheets containing <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
      software like <strong>Aldus PageMaker</strong> including versions of <em>Lorem Ipsum.</em></p>
      <h4>Why Do We Use It?</h4>
      <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
      content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is that it has
      a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use
      <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> as their default model text, and a search for <em>'lorem ipsum'</em> will uncover many web sites
      still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
      sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
      <h4>So, what have we learned?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is weird.</li>
        <li>What <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> actually means.</li>
        <li>Why we use it.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>What do I do with my life now?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Read this page once an hour, every hour, no matter how fast the universe is expanding.</li>
        <li>Ask your doctor if <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is right for you.</li>
        <li>Tell your friends about the benefits of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://lipsum.com/">Maybe it's time they switched to <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> too!</a></li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong>, <strong>commit</strong>, <strong>push</strong>, and <strong>shove</strong> <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> three times daily for best results.</li>
      </ul>
