My name is Sen and I'm from Russia. Some of my hobbies include making art and
learning languages, including programming ones. I also write silly poems sometimes.
In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy books and playing video games.

There are a lot of things I want to be good at, for example composing music and
playing video games on hard difficulty, but I guess nobody's perfect.
